# How to create an effective DAO

## Purpose and Mission

- Define your DAO's purpose (why you exist, your reason for being)
  - Why are you building this DAO? What problem are you solving or opportunity are you pursuing?
  - What change do you want to make in the world? What's your vision for a better future?
  - Ensure your purpose statement is clear, compelling, focused, and sets boundaries around your efforts
- Define your DAO's mission (what you are doing to realize your purpose)
  - What specific actions will your DAO take to fulfill its purpose? What's your unique approach?
  - Articulate your mission in a concise statement that supports your purpose
  - Communicate your purpose and mission clearly to current and prospective members

## Strategy

- Develop your DAO's strategy (how you will achieve your mission)
  - What is your overall approach and plan to advance your mission and reach your goals?
  - Develop a simple, focused strategy for each key function/domain (product, marketing, community, etc)
  - Ensure strategies are matched to your current stage and resources
- Prioritize using "even over" statements
  - What are the most critical things your DAO must do well to succeed?
  - What trade-offs and compromises are you willing to make to prioritize what matters most?
- Define key metrics/KPIs to measure progress
  - What measurable results will show you are executing your strategies and advancing your mission?
  - Track and report on these metrics regularly to gauge performance and iterate

## Membership

- Define your DAO's fluid membership model with "layers of the onion"
  - Who are your target members? What skills, experience and qualities are you looking for?
  - Map out the different levels of membership from passive followers to core contributors
  - Clarify the boundaries and requirements for progressing to higher levels of membership
- Create an effective onboarding process
  - Orient new members to your DAO's purpose, mission, values and culture
  - Provide clear first steps for new members to start contributing and integrating with teams
  - Help new members build relationships with other DAO members
- Foster a thriving culture aligned with your purpose and values
  - Define your DAO's core values that shape behavior and reinforce your purpose
  - Live out these values to create your target culture
  - Use rituals and events to bond members and develop your DAO's unique personality

## Structure and Workflow

- Design a responsive organizational structure
  - Organize members into semi-autonomous groups, guilds, pods, or sub-DAOs
  - Clarify the responsibilities of each group and how they support the overall mission
  - Enable coordination between groups while preserving their flexibility
- Establish processes for how work gets done
  - Use bounties/tasks, sprints, dynamic roles, or project teams to organize work
  - Provide collaboration tools and rituals to help teams communicate and execute effectively
  - Allow structure and workflow to evolve as the DAO grows and learns
- Organize activities into focused workstreams
  - Define workstreams for key activities like product, engineering, growth, operations, etc.
  - Appoint workstream leads to coordinate efforts and maintain alignment with DAO priorities
  - Hold regular workstream syncs to share progress, remove blockers and integrate efforts

## Authority and Governance
git remote add origin git@github.com-insideai:human-software-language/dao.git
- Distribute authority to make decisions and take actions
  - Define what members can do by default vs. what requires permission or a vote
  - Decentralize power to teams and roles to the greatest extent possible
  - Use role-based governance to define decision rights and accountabilities
- Make group decisions via advice, consent, or voting
  - Use advice process for decisions impacting the whole DAO or requiring expertise
  - Aim for consent (no objections) for policy/governance changes after incorporating feedback
  - Reserve voting for high-stakes decisions that require broader buy-in from token holders
- Default to transparent communication and open information sharing
  - Make all work in progress visible and all key data/metrics accessible
  - Communicate in public channels and minimize private back-channel discussions
  - Share context to enable decentralized decision-making without centralized control

## Compensation and Incentives

- Collaboratively allocate resources to teams based on need and priorities
  - Provide resources at the core DAO level to be distributed to groups upon request
  - Allow teams with expertise to control their own budgets within guidelines
  - Transparently share allocation decisions and enable teams to provide input
- Design compensation to incentivize talent and performance
  - Use a consistent compensation framework considering market rates, internal equity, and DAO affordability
  - Consider self-set salaries, reputation-based rewards, or other innovative approaches
  - Make compensation transparent and regularly re-assess to ensure fairness
- Provide non-financial incentives and intrinsic rewards
  - Focus on recognition, impact, autonomy, mastery, and purpose to motivate contributors
  - Award badges, POAPs, and other earned perks to acknowledge contributions
  - Cultivate a culture where the work itself is inherently fulfilling

## Business Model

- Define your DAO's business model and revenue streams
  - How will your DAO sustainably generate revenue and capture value?
  - What products/services will you offer to whom and how will you monetize them?
  - Ensure your business model aligns with and supports your purpose and mission
- Validate your target market and value proposition
  - Who are your target users/customers and what are their key needs and pain points?
  - How are you uniquely positioned to serve them better than alternatives?
  - Validate your assumptions about product-market fit and willingness to pay
- Identify economic moats and flywheels
  - What unique assets, network effects, or economies of scale can you develop?
  - How can you create value-adding loops that compound your growth?
  - What incentive structures can reward participants and reinforce your competitive advantages?

## Economics and Funding

- Design a sustainable economic model
  - Balance reinvestment in growth with delivering returns/value to members and users
  - Model key drivers of costs, revenues, margins, and capital efficiency over time
  - Allocate resources between internal operations and member/user benefits
- Determine an appropriate funding strategy
  - Forecast your capital requirements across development and growth stages
  - Evaluate funding options including token sales, membership dues, grants, and private investment
  - Define target raise amounts, use of funds, and desired investor profile
- Develop a token economic model (if applicable)
  - Specify your token's purpose, utility and governance rights
  - Define mint/emission schedule, distribution, supply cap, and unlock periods
  - Design token sinks/burns, staking incentives, and value accrual/capture mechanisms

## Continuous Improvement

- Implement a quarterly "operating system" meeting to evolve your DAO
  - Collect feedback and input from members on what's working well or not
  - Discuss potential changes and decide which ones to implement after testing
  - Document, communicate and implement upgrades to your DAO's "operating system"
- Adopt the "looping" process to sense tensions, propose practices, and run experiments
  - Proactively surface tensions, issues and opportunities for improvement
  - Tap member creativity to generate potential solutions and new ideas
  - Make it safe to propose and test changes on a small scale to keep evolving
