# DAO club 10 lessons season 1:

[Music] foreign you now know how this course is structured and the modules we'll be covering so it's time to dive into the first lesson focused on purpose and Mission we'll first Define the terms purpose and Mission and discuss their importance in the context of Adele we'll then look at some examples of purpose statements and mission statements and discuss the synergies and the differences between them I'll then give you a practical exercise to complete in order to help you define your own Dao's purpose and Mission seeing as colony is a Dell framework we get to speak to New Dell Founders and builders on a daily basis and what we're noticing is that many Builders often get caught up in the technical details very early on such as tokenomics tooling governance processes growth hacking strategies and so forth now although it's understandable to be excited about starting a new Venture especially when you're supported by a small group of passionate contributors we usually advise to just pause for a minute don't start your journey without knowing precisely where you're headed and why you're heading there first ask yourself and your founding members why do we exist why is the work we do so important strong communities have a very clear and explicit sense of who they are why they exist and what they stand for your why is not about making money that's a result your why is a purpose a course or a belief it's the very reason the Dao exists when any organization has a clear sense of why it can Inspire others and attract loyal followers supporters and contributors people do better work when their daily life connects to something bigger so Inspire potential contributors with a vision of the future that will make the world a better place then demonstrate your own passion for that future it will be contagious ideally everything in your Dell from its members to its activities as processes and its values must point back and strengthen its purpose now some organizations call this their vision statement call it whatever you want purpose statement vision statement core purpose organizational philosophy it doesn't really matter just make sure you capture the essence of why your reason for being is so important your Dow's purpose serves as a North star guiding the organization in the right direction this is especially important in Dallas where we don't have CEOs senior Executives and managers steering a huge cruise ship in Dallas there is less of this command and control structure and there should be a lot more sensing and responding we should instead operate as a Regatta of little speed boats where each individual and team has the autonomy to explore and contribute more fluidly without stifling bureaucracy and a rigid formal chain of command now remember these little speed boats can travel in any direction so it's even more important to have a very clear North Star guiding all of the Dow members in the same direction but we want our boats to be Loosely coupled and tightly aligned as a whole if you haven't yet clearly defined your own Dao's purpose here are some guidelines to keep in mind number one a great purpose is clear and compelling new ideas need to be clear in order to spread easily so potential new contributors need to understand it immediately and get excited by it number two it focuses attention and energy so concentrate that excitement and energy into something very very specific don't be too vague and number three it must place a boundary around our efforts to avoid any distractions especially in web 3 we see so many Founders wanting to implement hundreds of different strategies but hardly any of them actually support the Dao's true purpose so really keep those three guidelines in mind when developing your own purpose statement the following purpose statements are all from very successful companies but the principle stays the same and it applies to any organization instead we spread ideas CSV Health we help people on their path to Better Health Foods we nourish people and the planet Unilever we make sustainable living commonplace and Patagonia we save our home planet now you'll see how all of these purpose statements are very aspirational they are clear and compelling and they also Focus energy as well as placing a boundary around why they all exist okay we now know that purpose is why you're driven so what's a mission then well your Dao's mission is what drives you a Dao's purpose is about why it exists and its Mission describes what it does to realize that purpose a purpose is delivered via its Mission so purpose equals why and Mission equals what purpose and Mission not only harmonize but they also enrich each other playing very distinctive but crucial roles in your Dao's strategy now let's look at some purpose and mission statements of dowels you might already be familiar with first up is git coin their purpose is to empower communities to fund their shared needs and it delivers this purpose via its mission to build a widely adopted modular grounds protocol that creates a flourishing ecosystem of funding mechanisms next up is bankless their purpose is to make Financial Independence decentralized work and creative freedom accessible to all which it delivers via its mission to create user-friendly on-ramps for people to discover use learn and enjoy the benefits of web 3. now let's look at moondale their purpose is to decentralize access to space and delivers that via its mission to create a self-sustaining self-governing settlement on the Moon by 2030 to act as a launch point for Humanity to explore the cosmos and finally let's look at Dow club's purpose why do we exist well to fuel the growth of successful dowels in the world and our mission I.E what are we doing to fulfill our purpose well it's to empower Dell Builders by providing them with the knowledge the network the resources and the support they need to succeed okay that's all the content for lesson one here's what you need to do next number one Define your purpose and mission statements remember for purpose statement why do you exist what is your reason for being and for mission statement you need to be thinking about what you are doing to realize your purpose number two dowels operate on principles of transparency and inclusivity therefore the purpose and Mission should be communicated clearly and openly to all members and to potential new members they should be easily accessible on your website or Twitter or your blog it doesn't really matter it's one of the best ways to attract potential contributors because you want them to read it and say wow I believe I can do my life's best work in support of this mission number three reinforce these statements as part of your onboarding process new members should become deeply deeply familiar with them and number four make sure all Dow members activities processes and values all point back to and strengthen the Dow's purpose and Mission you must live out these statements by doing everything in alignment with them below this video there is a link to some online resources that will give you inspiration to formulate your own Dao's purpose and mission statements don't worry about it being perfect especially if you're just getting started just put some words on paper to make it real you can always refine your purpose and mission statements over time they can and they will adapt and evolve as the Dow grows and changes over time this flexibility is essential for long-term sustainability anyway now remember in order to graduate from this course and receive your Dow Builder level 1 certification you'll be required to submit all your homework from each lesson for review and for lesson one you'll be required to submit your purpose and mission statements good luck [Music]
[Music] welcome to lesson number two how did you get on with your purpose and mission statement I hope you at least have a rough draft ready of each on paper this lesson focuses on strategy and will build on what you've learned so far now of course we could talk about strategy for hours but this video is only going to cover the basics so let's Dive In first what is a strategy well a strategy is a way of describing how you are going to get things done a strategy is less specific than an action plan or a project plan which tells you the who what and when that's not what we're talking about here instead it tries to broadly answer the question how do we get from here to there if we're standing at Point a right now how do we reach our mission at point B now remember from lesson one we said your purpose informs your mission well your mission informs your strategy you already know your why and your what so next you need to think about your how how are you going to achieve your mission however from one purpose and one Mission comes several strategies it's important to note though that you should only ever have one strategy per function domain or working group of your Dell you should not have two product strategies or two go to market strategies at the same time this will just confuse everyone although your Dow's purpose and Mission will mostly remain consistent the strategies will change and must be flexible enough to react with external factors so you might follow one strategy and then pivot to a different one after but don't Implement them both at the same time the problem with many projects is not the lack of a compelling Vision or Mission it's the lack of strategy to get there your Dow members need to trust that you have a plan and idea in place of how to move from point A to point B once you have that trust they will help you move towards the vision so have a clear strategy in place to build that trust from the outset to recap then your purpose explains your why your mission describes what you're doing to fulfill your purpose and your strategy describes how you are going to achieve your mission why what how now let's look at some organizational strategy examples the first one is from maker Dell we'll look at purpose Mission and strategy their purpose is to create an unbiased Global Financial system the mission to Foster the proliferation acceptance and use of a stable non-discriminatory currency that users control and the strategy the how create and maintain a system that allows users to generate dye by depositing collateral assets approved by maker governance whilst maintaining dye's softbeg to the US dollar and ensuring overcollaterization to cover the value of all outstanding debt a bit of a mouthful of course but yours does not have to be this complex next up let's look at Uni swap again purpose mission strategy the purpose to build trustless and highly decentralized Financial infrastructure mission to enable a persistent and censorship resistant source of financial liquidity with minimal value extraction and the organizational strategy the how to create and maintain an open source and censorship resistant protocol for providing liquidity and token trading on a public blockchain again of course yours does not have to be this technical if you're just building a social Dell and all you do is host cool parties to bring people together then that is your strategy no need to complicate it if you haven't developed a strategy yet and still working on how to get from point A to point B what are some criteria for creating a good strategy well number one it must Advance your mission a good strategy is fully consistent and in full alignment with your mission number two keep it simple make sure everyone in the Dow understands it you must be able to explain it in just a few sentences number three focus in and narrow the scope don't try multiple approaches at the same time and number four fit resources within opportunities a good strategy takes advantage of current resources and assets to seize existing opportunities when things change further down the line so will your strategy so just stay flexible When developing your strategy it's very important to prioritize your critical success factors now you might have many things that you wish to accomplish but there should only ever be one priority at organizational level and for each domain or working group within the Dell so the Dao and every other team or function should be asking themselves number one what do we need to prioritize above all else to succeed and number two what compromises do we have to make now to benefit our future if you're struggling to figure out what to prioritize then the even overstatement can be very useful the even overstatement which is a form of strategy development does a great job of indicating that even though we value the thing on the left we value the thing on the right even more Amazon for example might use the statement market share even over profit margin to clarify that although profitability is important at this moment the company would rather invest cash flow in further cementing its dominance in the market good even overstatements prioritize one good thing over another good thing for instance small sustainable business even over a global Enterprise user growth even over Revenue conversions user-friendly desktop experience even over a mobile experience local clients even over global clients or great user experience even over decentralization so by using even over statements we can prioritize a list of multiple success factors and bring Clarity to what's the most important right now this is a great exercise for you to carry out across all of your different functions or working groups to surface their most relevant and important critical success factor right now so what does this look like in practice let me give you an example of how we used the even overstatement to prioritize Dell club's critical success factors and set our strategy as a reminder Dow club's mission is to empower Dell Builders by providing them with the knowledge network resources and support they need to succeed now how can we advance our mission well first we made a list of all the things we can do to empower our Dow Builders things like online meetings in real life meetings asynchronous communication channels live social Gatherings live workshops courses video tutorials mentorship guidance and even funding but what do we need to focus on to advance our mission right now so we said online meetings even over in real life meetings asynchronous communication channels even over live social Gatherings courses and video tutorials even over live workshops and mentorship and guidance even over funding so Dow club's strategy has been developed from those even overstatements into host weekly online events for Dow Builders to learn develop and grow their relationships with each other provide them with a platform to network and communicate in a private members only area and that is our strategy okay so you now have a strategy but how do you know it's working how do we know we're advancing our mission and how do we measure the progress we're making whilst moving from point A to point B these measurements or kpis or metrics all differ from dial to Dell it's definitely not a one-size-fits-all approach for instance some kpis for protocol dials may include tvl total value locked protocol Revenue transaction volume number of unique token holders or number of Integrations some kpis for social and cultural dials may include member engagement member activation member retention activity on governance forums or number of events and participants some kpis for developer Focus dials may include number of GitHub stars or commits number of features released and bugs resolved number of unique developers contributing and so forth although tracking these progress metrics is important remember every Dao is unique and what matters to me might not matter to you so make sure you understand why your metrics matter to you don't just measure progress on things that don't really move the needle okay that's all the content for lesson number two here's what you need to do next number one develop your dials organizational strategy if you already have groups or teams carrying out different functions then develop a strategy for each of these two like a marketing strategy a communication strategy or a service strategy forget the word strategy just write down how your Dow is working towards its Mission like how does it actually work day to day what is the business model keep it plain and simple so that a five-year-old can understand it number two communicate your organizational strategy clearly for everyone on the outside and the inside of the Delta see whether it's a website a Twitter a blog or a notion page use it to attract Talent into your Dell number three make sure new contributors understand your organizational strategy and implement the team level strategy in which they are contributing to they must clearly understand how they are going to get things done on a daily basis and finally number four set kpis that matter and measure progress over monthly and quarterly periods to make sure you are actually advancing your mission using a rapid feedback loop okay this is the end of lesson number two of season one remember in order to join season two the cohort with live weekly meetings with other Dow Builders you must submit your organizational strategy upon completion of this course so write down a short strategy paragraph in your homework document to make sure you don't fall behind if your Dow is already up and running I'm sure you already have some form of strategy written down in a white paper or in an internal knowledge base you can just copy it into your homework document ready for review at the end of lesson eight good luck foreign [Music]
[Music] hello welcome to lesson number three how did you get on with your strategy development I hope you've got a short paragraph written down that explains how your Dow is working towards its Mission this lesson number three is about membership we've discussed the why the What the how so next we need to look at Who Your da is for who are the people you're looking to attract in support of your mission this lesson will focus on defining the relationship ships the culture but also the boundaries of what it means to be a member we have a lot to cover so let's dive in in traditional corporations otherwise known as Legacy organizations membership is often seen as a binary concept you're either officially employed and considered a member of the company or you're not without an employment agreement in place you're not recognized as a member however membership is not a simple binary State not every employee feels the same level of loyalty inclusion or engagement membership is more than just a legal status it's a social status it represents your identity within the organization akin to being a cell within a living organism in a dow the concept of membership becomes much more flexible and fluid your membership boundaries similar to cell membranes can Encompass multiple teams fun ions or social groups and even different contribution zones Dows blur the lines between community members token holders participants contributors and even core members at Colony we try to Define these loose membership boundaries as layers of an onion the very outer layer of the membership onion is our public social media channels where someone might initially become a Community member by following us on Twitter they might then move one layer in and join our Discord some Discord members May then go on and buy our native token to become a token holder or they may not note that members can progress to becoming participants in our community initiatives without having to buy any tokens some members might grow such an affinity with Colony that they want to contribute part-time to The Meta colony which is colony's Dow by becoming a contributor you also join a cell within a layer which groups functions together such as marketing development or product and some part-time contributors may even decide to become full-time core contributor gaining the ultimate level of influence in the D now it's important to understand that your membership is not static Within These layers but fluid and dynamic so members can move around between layers or cells and be part of multiple ones at the same time in traditional companies if your boss fires you from your possession it it means you're also fired from the entire company your team membership and your membership in the organization are essentially the same thing so if you're no longer part of the team you're no longer part of the company however this approach only makes sense if we think of our organization as a machine and our people as mechanical cogs in that perspective there are specific roles that require specific skills and one Cog can only be placed by another Cog but if we view the organization as a dynamic system and our people as individuals with various talents and passions then things work out very differently we can separate team membership from overall organizational membership a person can have one role or multiple roles within the organization they can search for available roles or even create a new one that suits their skills and interests decisions on who to fill these roles must go through traditional governance processes to ensure competency and if someone fails to uphold the organization's core values or doesn't fulfill their commitments they might have to leave however for the majority of talented individuals who have a lot to contribute the organization can be like a jungle gym offering flexibility and opportunities of growth instead of being a rigid machine in adal the interactions amongst its members hold much greater significance than the individual Parts Simply Having a group of talented individuals doesn't guarantee a successful team it's the relationships within the organization that Define the collective potential every interaction we have starting from the initial meeting with potential members until they leave the D shapes their experience as members these experiences in turn cont contribute to the overall Fabric and strength of the network the Dow's core values play a vital role here as they provide a clear Direction guide decision-making shape behavior and culture attract and retain members and contribute to the Dow's reputation and trustworthiness they are the moral compass that ensures the Dow operates in alignment with its Mission whilst fostering a thriving and purposeful Community as a dow founder it is your responsibility to cultivate and express this membership experience through the culture the core values and the overall Vibes these elements are crucial in shaping the atmosphere and environment within the Dow ensuring a positive and meaningful experience for all members okay next how do you go about selecting members to become part of your Dow most Dows have closed membership models with at least some entry requirements in place note that these Dows may still have open Discord servers or telegram chats where anyone can become a Community member but it does not make them an official Dow member with governance rights or any influence let's look at some examples of closed membership models number one is invitation people are invited to join the Dow by buying membership such as a token or nft the barrier to entry here is still very low as big Dows may have tens or even hundreds or thousand thousand of members such as Unis swap compound or a the second is application potential members have to apply to become a member and are evaluated by the Dow's contributors or members before they can join and number three referral potential new members have to be referred by current members in order to apply these types of dows are quite small in comparison and usually quite exclusive the most common form of invitation membership is where those who hold the Dow's governance token are considered to be the actual Dow members however this seems to be a trend moving away from fungible erc20 tokens towards nfts as access instead in either case as long as you hold the Dow's token you're a dow member who has governance rights but as soon as you sell your tokens or nfds you're no longer considered a dow member this can have a dram Matic impact on the growth of the Dow as market conditions and speculation end up being the main drivers for people joining so really think about that let's look at some earned membership models next with these you can't simply go and buy membership access tokens you have to earn them at Colony those who contribute to the Dow The Meta Colony earn reputation and only those with the reputation are considered Dow members your level of reputation in the Dow determines your level of influence and Power in governance decisions you cannot buy or sell your reputation you can only earn it by doing work or adding value to the D similarly we're now seeing models where members can actually earn badges soulbound nfts which are awarded to them based on certain criteria this can be for work that they've done roles that they hold or maybe ways that they've participated in these badges are also so nontransferable so membership cannot be bought or sold we've seen Dows using a range of badges for different levels of influence in governance okay so you've defined your membership model and members are starting to join your D but what does this process look like how do you welcome someone new a member who is onboarded properly feels a sense of belonging and has a keen sense of how to move in and out of membership spaces Within the Dow a member who is thrust into a team or role without the required context will feel uncomfortable unclear and completely overwhelmed a strong onboarding process is critical so make sure you've got the following elements in place number one make the new member feel welcome and safe in this new environment especially if it's their first time contributing to a d number two familiarize them with the Dow's purpose mission strategy core values and guidelines number three direct them towards a clear first few steps of contribution so they can hit the ground running number four clarify what commitment is expected from them understanding their role and responsibilities is crucial and number five help them make their first one-on-one connections within the group or team that they are contributing to by taking these five steps you'll make great strides in keeping your new members happy once your members have have been properly onboarded give them the freedom and autonomy to explore and contribute more fluidly as discussed during lesson one we talked about purpose and Mission and how Dows must sense and respond like a rata of little speedboats a murmuration of Starlings or a school of fish members should not be bound by this static hierarchical command and control structure of Legacy corporations and as early stage D Founders it's natural to feel like you must maintain control and keep things on track which of course you should but as the Dow grows and matures you should put measures in place to relinquish your control keep your purpose and Mission front and center set your strategy towards your mission maintain the culture and place trust in your members traditional corporations tend to have non-compete clauses in contracts to prohibit employ employees from creating or joining competitive firms during employment or for a period after termination or even prevent them from leaving until their contract expires and a certain Milestone is reached holding someone hostage doesn't create Peak Performance it creates resentment and disagreement Dows don't tend to operate under these conditions there are often no formal employment contracts in place but instead operate on contractor based agreements there's also little evidence of non-compete and contributors can work for multiple Dows at the same time so without these shackles holding contributors back it is of course easier for them to come and go so as a dow founder it is part of your role to create a place that no one wants to leave the culture values and Vibes of a DA are critical aspects in attracting and retaining Talent so make sure you reinforce and really live by your core values most DS think about how the experience starts but many don't have a plan for How It Ends giving members the freedom to leave but also having clear processes in place for member exits are very important it allows the Dow to pragmatically trim the fat by removing inactive or underperforming members removing toxic influences and dissolving teams groups or functions no longer fit for purpose there have been instances in the past where contributors have failed to uphold the Dow's core values and a proposal calling for their removal failed following a token weighted vote it highlights the importance of thinking well in advanc on how these exit points should be governed and what the process should be so really think about that okay that's all the cont content for lesson number three here's what you need to do next number one create a membership onion for your Dow capture all of the layers from the outer community members to the inner core contributor if your Dow is not open to members yet then Define what this will look like in the future number two communicate it to everyone publicly be transparent and show potential new members the levels of contribution number three make sure new contributors are onboarded properly and understand how and where they can get started number four express the entire membership experience through your culture your core values and your Vibes and finally number five create clear exit points with processes in place to offboard members to when they leave in your homework document which you'll have to submit in order to join season two you'll see there is a space to complete your membership onion and also write down your D core values that is your homework that must be done there is however a link to a template below this video that you can use to help you develop this membership onion or you can just draw one from scratch using an online drawing tool good luck [Music]
[Music] hello welcome back this is lesson number four how did you get on with completing your membership onion and your core values I hope you're staying up to date with your homework this lesson is all about structure and workflow so how do we structure the dell and how does the work flow through the structure let's get started so what is the right way to structure a Dell well to be honest that's the wrong question the correct question and the one you should be asking yourself is what is the right way to structure this dough based on what we're building or looking to achieve so just a quick caveat nothing in this video is the blueprint or the best practice for structuring it out every Dow was unique so you might find some of what I have to say applicable but whatever is not relevant to you just disregard it and do what works for your Dell in the early days of a startup there's only one team and it's all hands on deck while we may have different skills and experience we come together in a much more fluid way jumping in and out of tasks as needed Founders co-founders and early employees wear many different hats so a Founder might be doing marketing product development and customer services at the same time but with success the workload becomes too great and we have to bring on more people so suddenly it's much harder to keep tabs on who's doing what and the work gets more specialized and so we start to Define roles and over time these roles expand into separate functions which eventually form isolated groups collaboration is key to get things done though and often requires a substantial amount of communication and coordination so when achieving this harmony becomes too tough we end up resorting to a rigid hierarchy sacrificing our Innovative drive for a more streamlined structure in this setup everyone has a superior who in turn reports to another Superior and so on this fixed hierarchy can curb creativity hinder our flexibility and adaptability and generally slows down operations decision making becomes a lengthy process that requires multiple approvals all the time so let this be a word of warning to you when your Dao starts to scale be cautious not to fall into this restrictive pattern we should Aspire for our doubt to act like a dynamic Network there is no CEO or c-level Executives there is no formal command and control hierarchy members of this system have the freedom to organize around projects in order to seize opportunity and accelerate their own personal growth members can hold one role or multiple roles in multiple places at the same time and they can maintain a more interesting set of relationships across the entire network teams of teams operate as cells in a network each with their own purpose talent and information can flow freely a project can be defined and contributed from different guilds or working groups can come together to complete it let's look at some examples of how Dows are currently structured get coin is structured into what they call work streams each group responsible for a certain function with a work stream lead coordinating all of the work Forefront is structured into guilds The Writer's guilt the growth Guild and the culture Guild and within each of these guilds they have specialist teams so in the writer's Guild they have editorial Education and Research teams make Adele has now introduced the concept of sub-dials these sub-dials are self-standing unique mini dowels they're semi-independent nature helps segregate complexity from the makerdale core however subdial governance runs on top of maker course governance infrastructure and maker token holders retain control of many of the subdials assets so as you can see there are many different ways to think about structuring a Dell okay let's say a Dao has a defined structure in place but how do these guilds or work streams or working groups actually get work done Pablo who is currently a lead engineer and core contributor at moondel has a spicy take on this he goes on to say that to get things done guilds do not work because they are large teams of low context people there's low commitment from Members so Things fall through a lack of deadlines means that things take forever a lack of strong entry criteria means that anyone can join and the same questions keep popping up because of low context people in each Guild however he goes on to say that projects do work because a project team is aligned with the Dao through a vote that clearly lists its objectives and success factors small teams of people are focused on tasks joining a project requires commitment upfront leaders can remove people who are hindering the completion of tasks and finally deadlines and priorities mean that stuff actually get done but he also argues that guilds can be used as a soft culture building when onboarding into a Dell with low commitment upfront however members who truly want to get involved should not stay in a guild for long they should join a project to actually get real work done now what Pablo was describing there can be considered the concept of Slam teams slam stands for self-managed lean audacious and multi-disciplinary now exactly what is a slam team and how might that concept be applied to Adele a series of Slam teams are assembled to complete independent missions or projects from the beginning to the end in practice this means that each team is pursuing an audacious goal for the Dell with the authority to make decisions and to work unencumbered no outside reviews input or feedback from the Dow can disrupt the work that they are doing the team is totally self-managed in addition slam teams are lean so they are small enough to move quickly but they are also multi-disciplinary meaning they contain all of the skills and the experience that they need to achieve their mission introducing a few teams like this can really take a step forward to creating a responsive structure and can result in much shorter cycle times and better outcomes so in this graphic you might assemble a team completely focused on designing and building a website another team in colony's case is working totally independently on our Standalone project called coin machine and yet another team is solely responsible for delivering a product launch campaign again these teams work from start to finish independently from other teams within the dell and without their supervision this is where trust and accountability really comes into play another useful structure is dynamic deeming find a part of your Dell where teams change regularly and turn it into a dynamic two-way Marketplace first create a talent pool of part-time contributors with various skills you can see them pulled here together in the middle the rules are simple number one project teams or specific functions like software development for instance have the authority in the Dell to add and remove members from the talent pool number two members have the ability to join or leave teams with reasonable notice rule number three members can manage their own bandwidth so they can actually hold more than one role open roles are shared transparently with the talent pool and members can apply by meeting with the team discussing the work and then sharing what they have to offer you might have a formal or an informal process here in place but it's really just a search for a good two-way fit this also works really well with more ad hoc Bounty based work so give it a try Okay so we've talked about the structure but how do we manage and coordinate the work well one way to keep your team on track is to work in short bursts or Sprints so instead of relying on the Project's timeline and complexity try running your project as a series of one or two week Sprints you can think of a Sprint as a mini deadline where you need to produce and share a piece of work before the end of that deadline this is of course not A New Concept A lot of traditional startups have been using this approach as part of scrum and agile project management Frameworks for a very long time but guess what it actually seems to work pretty well in Dallas too Sprints can actually help your team develop good habits that don't often come unless there's a fast pace for starters they get teams moving if you know you have to finish something by the end of the first week you won't waste time overthinking minor things like choosing an image for a blog post Sprints also make teams break down the work into smaller manageable pieces if you're building a protocol or a decentralized app it's not going to be done in a week so teams need to figure out what can be accomplished like creating a basic version of a product designing a prototype or shipping a new feature design Because by the end of the Sprint something needs to be ready to go and of course Sprints make decisions happen much faster instead of arguing or fretting over what could be the time limit means that it's much better to just make a decision than wait if we show our users or our community the work from the Sprint and it turns out we were off Target so what we only spent a week or two going down a path that could have wasted months under any different circumstances okay that's all the content for lesson number four here's what you need to do next number one create a structure diagram for your doubt in whatever way you want to visualize it number two communicate it to everyone on the outside of your Dell to see be transparent and show potential contributors where they might fit in considering their skills and their experience number three make sure new contributors understand their roles and their responsibilities and how to get started and number four create simple agreements about how teams are formed and changed and then let people go where their skills and energy take them right you're about halfway through this course well done on getting this far to help you create a structure diagram follow the link below this video to a template that you can use as a basis for your own or if the template doesn't resemble what you had in mind just draw one from scratch using an online drawing tool in your homework document make sure you paste this structure diagram and also complete all of the questions in the structure and workflow section I'll see you in lesson number five keep going and good luck [Music]
[Music] hello welcome to lesson number five I hope you've got a first draft of your structure diagram developed from Lesson Four this lesson focuses on Authority and governance so how do we share power and make decisions how do we distribute the right to make those decisions take actions and get others to do the same now these are huge topics that we could spend weeks on but this is only season one so we're only going to cover the basics let's jump in when you join a big traditional company you're usually not allowed to do anything unless someone says you can the big bosses and the senior managers get to make all of the decisions and it can sometimes feel like you're just a small part of a big machine now this happens because those people think that the best way to stop bad things from happening is to make sure that everyone follows the rules but really it's all just about control now it starts off pretty simple simple in the beginning everyone is rushing around to try and get the company off the ground but as the company grows it tries to stay safe and avoids any risks by making sure that everyone follows the policies the rules and the regulations and as more time goes by there are so many rules that you can't do anything fun or exciting without getting permission from several layers of management and the result is unauthorized employees develop a a sense of apathy and learned helplessness engagement declines decisions get made slowly and stories of mistakes and failures create a Culture of Fear Dows should give our contributors the freedom and autonomy to do what they can to advance the DA's Mission here the starting idea is that you can do anything unless there is a specific rule or agreement that says you can't so we start from a position of trust instead of having all the power concentrated at the top with just a few big bosses we want to distribute the power to the teams and the individuals right to where all of that action is our teams are in charge of their own work and how they do it so if something is getting in their way or stopping them from doing their job they can try to fix it themselves so the result is more freedom leading to more learning and better performance engagement improves and decisions get made much quicker but operating like this requires new ways of decision- making we need to use our purpose core values and principles to make sure our decisions are sound that means we have to take the time to figure out what decisions each person role and team can make knowing who can make a decision and how they should do it is critical it cannot be left undefined finded or unclear but what we're asking our contributors to do here is a big deal you need to be emotionally mature have self-awareness and be professional to flourish in this environment but even if it sounds counterintuitive having more freedom actually helps us to learn more and learning more makes us better in the corporate world today how many employees don't have the power they need to do their jobs properly we living in a fast changing era where stopping people from making decisions and using their own judgment can prevent your organization from reaching its true potential in most old school companies managers believe that everyone's job is to do everything perfectly mistakes not allowed failure no way and so we use all our knowledge and lots of effort to make our teams work like well-oiled machines but there's a problem they're not machines they're people like we said during lesson number three our members form part of an emergent complex system and by only focusing on doing things perfectly we stop the system from growing naturally in Dows our job isn't to be perfect it's to create a culture where we're always learning and that means trusting people and letting go along the same lines of creating Freedom within your doubt maximizing Freedom means minimizing policy Jason freed and David Hansen from base camp warned that isolated incidents can too easily lead to bureaucracy I love this quote from their book rework policies are organizational Scar Tissue they are codified overreactions to situations that are unlikely to happen again they are collective punishment for the misdeeds of an IND individual this is governing for the exception rather than the rule in other words don't overreact at Bas Camp they only Institute a new policy when something negative happens over and over again so ask yourself what's the smallest amount of policy required to protect us whilst preserving the flexibility to learn and act without judgment some of you might be familiar with the company called WL Gore that makes gortex and they've really shaken up the way things are usually done in corporations they have this guiding principle called the water line and it says the following everyone at Gore must consult with other knowledgeable and experienced colleagues before doing things that might be below the water line and could seriously hurt the Enterprise the water line principle is a great way to think about it imagine imagine a boat if there's a hole in the boat above the water it's okay the boat can keep floating but if there's a hole below the water line it's bad news the boat might sink that kind of mistake is really hard to fix so at Gore they use the advice process which we'll talk about next when they have to make decisions below the water line the bigger decisions you can instill this waterline principle in your own Dow what kinds of decisions can everyone make without consulting others first how much power are you ready to give away without any conditions be clear about this and push back when contributors ask you if they can do something that's above the waterline ask them what they plan to do try to remove your own bus Factor whever you can so what about decisions that are risky and clearly below the water line one way is to let certain people or roles make those decisions only by implementing role-based governance but another way might be to use the advice process anyone should be able to make a big decision but they must ask advice from people who know a lot about the subject or will be affected by their decision that means they must find those people meet up with them oneon-one and talk about the options and potential outcomes to make the advice process work the person making this the decision must be open to asking for advice and really really listen people giving advice must be okay with their advice not being taken and they shouldn't try to influence the decision with popularity or expertise this isn't about trying to make everyone happy where a few bosses get to change the idea until it's pretty dull or uninspiring this is just advice nothing more once a decision has been made it should be shared with everyone along with the reasons and the viewpoints that helped shape it so that everyone can learn from it and for this to really work the person making the decision must take full responsibility for the outcomes and stay accountable when done well this creates a sense of ownership and responsibility that's really hard to match what happens if there are decisions that need more than just a few people to agree on it well when a new plan or idea is suggested in a perfect world the idea is great we hope that everyone will think it's awesome and everyone will agree with it but in real life it's not that easy some people might think it's the best thing ever some might think it's okay some might not really like it and some might even even hate it so just asking people to vote yes or no on an idea doesn't give you the whole picture Gerard endenburg brought sociocracy into the workplace about 50 years ago he said we need to understand the difference between consensus and consent in how we run things consensus means everyone agrees while consent means no objections he figured that consensus isn't just impossible at scale but it doesn't really reflect how Dynamic systems that adapt really work you're never going to get 100% agreement from everyone instead he argued that consent or no objections should be the main rule for running organizations and more importantly it should be informed consent he argued that all important decisions should be made with the informed consent of those affected by them enden BG's consent process has been brought back recently in a more structured form called integrative decision making or IDM IDM uses a series of rounds that work like a process for working through an idea or a proposal in each round the proposal gets better because the person suggesting it includes feedback and suggestions from others IDM focuses on including everyone and keeping things moving forward when discussing a proposal in this consent-based way people ask themselves is this good enough for now is it safe enough to try it doesn't have to be perfect and make everyone happy and if someone disagrees with a proposal they can't just say no to it but they must provide suggestions on how to make it safe to try so what does this integrative decision- making or IDM look like in practice imagine Gathering the team in an online video meeting it works best if a facilitator is appointed to manage the flow of the meeting Step One is propose a team member describes a tension that they're trying to solve followed by a proposal or a recommendation the proposer speaks and everyone else listens step two is clarify each participant is given the chance to ask questions to the proposer to understand the proposal the facilitator gives everyone a chance participant asks proposer answers and everyone else listens step three is react so going around the virtual table again the proposer gives each participant the chance to react and give feedback the proposer does not reply to reactions or feedback until the next round step four is adjust So based on the questions feedback and reactions the proposer May edit the proposal or not and clarify anything that was unclear the proposer may also remove the proposal at this time if they no longer wish to pursue it based on what they've learned step five is consent cycling through the team again each participant can voice an objection if they have one an objection is defined as a reason this would be unsafe to try or would cause irreversible harm to the team or organization this is a high bar by Design as the goal here is progress a safe step towards resolving the original tension step six is integrate those who object are invited to work with the proposer to edit the proposal making it smaller faster better cheaper whatever is required to achieve consent from both parties once all objections have been addressed the proposed proposal is accepted congratulations you've made a decision together murmer mm.com is an online tool used to make IDM an asynchronous consent process it doesn't require any tokens nfts reputation or web 3 type of voting you can also use notion or Google docs for this exact same process instead of the six steps of IDM it uses three phases understand improve and decide in this example we're using murmur so the user interface guides you through the process Step One is understand a dow member submits a proposal to the Dow or a team who will be directly impacted by it participants then ask questions to gain Clarity on the content of The Proposal this is not a time to make suggestions the proposer then answers the questions and participants will have a chance to review them at the beginning of the next round the next step is improve where participants make suggestions this is their one and only chance to provide feedback and recommend improvements participants will also log a reaction to give the proposer an overall impression of how they feel about it the proposer then has the opportunity to make edits and respond to the suggestions before asking for final consent the third and final step is decide part participants review the changes and responses to their suggestions they are then asked to either consent to it as written or object if they truly feel it is not safe to try if they choose to object they must try to shape it further to make it safe to try they must propose a sensible amendment to which they will consent nine times out of 10 if you really spend enough time in the improve phase to incorporate feedback it receives consent from everyone first time this three-step asynchronous process is a great way to quickly make consent-based decisions now I know what you're thinking what about web 3 what about token voting what about onchain governance you've come all this way and you didn't even mention snapshot well yes the truth is we've been getting so swept away with all the latest crypto voting tools and Frameworks that we've actually forgotten that it's possible to make decisions at scale without tokens nfts reputation or whatever I mean just look at all these tools it's actually overwhelming and they are growing by the day I mean which one is right for you of course there is no right or wrong answer here if your D doesn't have a token yet great why not use the waterline principle the advice process or even the consent process they are tried and tested methods that we use at Colony regularly and if you're using any of those tools already perhaps there's a way for you to distribute Authority and let members make decisions locally without having to vote on everything and trying to reach consensus on every decision now what we covered today lays the foundations I wanted to show you alternative offchain decision making Frameworks to make operational decisions we will however go much deeper into onchain Dow governance and look at many of the different tools and Frameworks during Dow clubs season 2 which you'll be able to join upon completion of this course okay that's all the content for lesson five here's what you need to do next in your homework document describe how your Dow makes decisions what is your process for collective decision making who has Authority and how is that Authority exercised if you're using fungible tokens then write that down if you're using nfts to vote then write that down if you're using cage fights or rock paper scissors to determine who has the most Authority then write that down there are no wrong answers just tell me what you do but put them in your homework document so that you can submit it at the end of the course in order to join our live coort during season 2 I look forward to seeing you in the next lesson good luck [Music]
[Music] hey welcome back this is lesson number six in the previous lesson we covered Authority and governance and I hope you are up to date with your homework so far in this lesson we'll look at resources and compensation so how do we invest our time and money the allocation of capital effort and other assets and how do we pay compensate and reward people for contributing to the Dell some really juicy topics so let's jump in so what exactly are resources if we think of Taos as complex living systems then resources are like the air they breathe every Organization no matter what it stands for needs to figure out how to use what it's got to achieve its goals every dollar you have is an opportunity to put something into action weather is running the day-to-day paying people for their work starting something new making outside Investments or even giving to charity or funding public goods resources mean possibilities every hour that someone puts in is a chance to pump some life into existing roles and projects take something on that's fresh and new build relationships learn something new or just take a break and recharge so to say it again resources are the oxygen of Adele and every choice we make either feeds or stops this web of possibilities that's why figuring out how to distribute resources is really important for keeping your dough healthy and going strong in the long run as we often do let's take a look at how old school organizations operate many if not most still rely on annual budgets decided by CFOs and top level Executives who aren't really involved in the teams they are setting the budget for this system to put it bluntly is broken in a world that's getting more and more complex and changing faster all the time these budgets are just too inflexible situations can change in a heartbeat but traditional budgets not so much for example what happens when the market takes a nosedive or if our users change their habits or if a new rival comes along and shakes up how we do business yearly budgets are often based on old news like how well we did last year and assumptions about things that might happen in a year's time or more into the future so basically corporate budgets are outdated the moment they are finalized however many organizations continue to stick to the budget as their management tool no matter the circumstances I really like this quote from Aaron dignan from his book Brave New work he says Revenue targets can act as a ceiling since there is no incentive to exceed them whereas budgets become a floor as there is no motivation to spend less it really highlights the Paradox around budgets where those at the bottom of the corporate ladder have no input or influence over the budgets themselves Legacy budgeting is broken so what's the alternative how can Dows think about budgeting vitalik buterin wrote an insightful blog post in 2020 titled Dows are not corporations there's a link to this essay below this video in this post he argues the following the things that can help ensure that an organization will actually turn out to be meaningfully decentralized include one a truly high level of autonomy for pods where the pods accept resources from the core and are occasionally checked for alignment and competence if they want to keep getting those resources but otherwise act entirely on their own and don't take any order from the call and number two highly decentralized and diverse core governance this does not require a governance token but it does require broader and more diverse participation in the core so he argues that what's needed is diverse governance at the core level and the Dow then receives funds or generates Revenue at core level which is then distributed to the individual pods or guilds or working groups upon request these pods then accept the resources from the core and are checked for alignment and competence if they want to keep getting those resources but otherwise they act entirely on their own and they don't take any orders from the core itself but today few organizations find the courage to relinquish central control over resources especially over funds but by being Dynamic and tapping into collective intelligence you'll find that resource allocation is drastically improved by experimenting with Dynamic collaborative budgeting Dows are much better able to allocate resources in a rapid changing environment but what exactly needs to be in place for this to work what are the guiding principles well number one allow your teams with knowledge and expertise to control their own budget number two give teams the authority to make their own decisions within the team number three provide those teams with the tools to give feedback to the core and check alignment and competence and number four provide open and transparent channels of communication for teams to learn from other teams teams must be able to react quickly based on new information from other teams in the Dow when teams have the right and the inclination to experiment with their own rules and their own Norms they can find ways to collaboratively leverage and preserve resources by really making the Dallas Capital everyone's Capital it will be much better deployed in service of the collective purpose so what does this look like in practice well the most common way of allocating resources in most dowels today requires a guild or a working group to submit a proposal to the Cordell requesting funding typically for a set duration of time or to fund a specific project an example here is the public goods working group of Ian s Dell submitting a funding request proposal for q1 and Q2 in such a proposal the working group is expected to clearly communicate the amount requested provide a detailed breakdown of how the funding will be used and the expected impact or outcomes of the funding in this case the working group requested 250 000 usdc and 50 each for six months and the proposal passed following an on-chain token weighted vote at Colony we use the advice process and the consent process to fund teams and projects for example in order to launch a new initiative within Dell Club I put a proposal forward to the meta Colony requesting 18 000 xdi for a six-month period Dow Members First had the opportunity to ask questions during the understand phase and then during the improve phase all members had a chance to make suggestions and I implemented several changes to make it safe to try the final version of The Proposal received consent from everyone and I was able to transfer the funds out of the meta Colony Treasury for Dow Builders the consent process might be a good way to seek participation in and contribution to Big important financial decisions or if you have a governance token you'll probably include your token holders in the decision-making process via a token vote either way when Dow members have the opportunity to provide input and really have their feedback considered and implemented it creates a very strong sense of ownership okay so now we've covered resources next let's look at compensation work is how we get the essentials food water and a roof over our heads but the way we think about getting paid has changed a lot over time it's not just about money anymore now we've got all sorts of Financial and non-financial perks to draw Us in keep us in and even inspire a super diverse group of workers yet despite lots of evidence saying otherwise companies still think that pay is the main thing that gets people excited to work when people can't find purpose or meaning in what they do they often see their jobs as nothing more than Stepping Stones leading to better titles and bigger paychecks but this mad rush by companies and workers show a real misunderstanding about how Bay is connected to things like satisfaction happiness and loyalty lots of research has tried to find the link between better pay bonus pay company profits and other performance markers what they've discovered is that there is no or even a slightly negative correlation between how much you pay and the results you get it turns out what makes us happy and what takes us off at work are actually two different things things that get us pumped up about our jobs include feeling recognized for our hard work having interesting tasks being part of important decisions and opportunities to grow and get better improving these aspects boosts Satisfaction by making the work itself more rewarding on the flip side factors like company policies job security how our bosses act and pay and benefits can lead to dissatisfaction but improving these factors can make the work environment better and lessen the dissatisfaction this should make us Think Twice As Leaders endows you can't buy your way to Performance and contribute to happiness it's not the same as a higher purpose to attract and retain good people Dows must focus on what actually motivates people being recognized for their work doing meaningful and interesting tasks getting a say in decisions and having chances to advance and grow so we've determined that pay and benefits are hygiene factors but they are still important we all have bills to pay and want to live a comfortable life right here we're talking about salaries for full-time or part-time contributors not one-off payments for specific tasks or bounties now you might only just be getting started and not at the point where you're paying your contributors salaries yet but it's still worth thinking about early on so how can we handle pay in Dallas one way to tackle favoritism and unfairness is through something called formulaic pay this is something companies like buffer use you can go to their website pop in a few details like the job that you're interested in how experienced you are and where you live and it will tell you what you'd earn if you worked there this is a take it or leave a deal once you've made it through their hiring process and your details are locked in there's no wiggle room for negotiation Market pay is another way to handle salaries this method leans into the idea of self-adjusting systems where many organizations set their pay rates based on what's typical in the market how they go about this can vary but basically they use the industry's average salary for a certain job as a starting point for deciding how much to pay this is a more personalized approach sometimes called paying the person it uses three questions to figure out the market value for a new team member number one what could they earn if they worked somewhere else number two what would we pay to replace them and number three how much would we pay to keep them if they got a better offer from another place the aim here is to make sure that each employee is always paid a certain percentage of what they're worth within the market but there's a catch this approach still depends on someone else's personal Judgment of another person's value and that can let unconscious bias and favoritism sneak in a third and to some perhaps controversial option is self-set Bay what if formulaic pay feels too simplified and Market pay seems too biased well you let your contributors decide their own salaries this process involves using both internal and external pay data looking at the Dell's financial situation and understanding the mix of roles contributors then suggest what they think their salary should be for the upcoming year at Colony we used the consent process to switch over to this self-set pay system before deciding our own salaries we have to consider the following factors how much do I need to earn to live well and be satisfied with my pay how do the next 12 months look for me in terms of workload and responsibility how much can Colony afford to pay considering our Runway and increased expenses how much do my fellow contributors earn in similar roles and how much do people with my skills experience and responsibilities earn elsewhere next an elected compensation committee made up of our own fellow contributors reviewed these proposals and provide feedback in the form of advice the transparency around compensation is sufficient for most people to make sound decisions that can withstand the scrutiny of their peers beyond that the benefits in financial Acumen stewardship and Collective responsibility that this approach produces are unparalleled compensation is something we give a lot of importance to yet it's almost funny that we hardly ever talk about it in the Western World especially talking about your salary is often seen as tasteless but here's a simple fix get rid of the awkwardness around salaries and make them transparent within the organization and even to the public buffer for instance along with sharing its salary formula also shares everyone's salaries and Equity openly on its website research on organizations that have open salaries reported more job applications lesser biases and increased trust and productivity so it's definitely something worth considering along with self-set pay at Colony we've also moved to open salaries all contributor salaries are open and visible to everyone else in the Dell due to the transparent nature of Dao's keeping salaries private will become increasingly more difficult so an Open salary policy will most likely be adapted by most Dells in the future dowels are meant to be on chain so paying contributors directly from the treasury should be standard practice anyway right to wrap up compensation it's worth noting the following no set formula level system skills Matrix or job titles can fully embrace the complexity of an actual team of contributors transparency open discussions and sound judgment are the only things that can truly help us navigate what's fair and even then we'll still be wrestling with unavoidable issues of bias and privilege which won't go away easily just keep in mind we are all human and this is where your emotional intelligence as a dow Builder will really come into play okay that's all the content for lesson number six here's what you need to do next in your homework document I'd like you to tell us how your Dao compensates its contributors if your dad was already open for contributors to join either part-time or full-time how will they be compensated when you're answering these questions think about the following are they receiving native tokens or stable coins if not what intrinsic motivation drives your contributors how is compensation determined and agreed upon please complete these questions in your homework document ready for submission at the end of this course that's all for now I'll see you in the next lesson good luck foreign [Music]
[Music] hello hello welcome back this is lesson number seven only two more to go in the previous lesson we looked at resources and compensation and I hope you've been thinking about those for your own da in this lesson we'll be looking at information and meetings so how do we share data and use that data how does the data flow and also how do we convene and coordinate amongst ourselves now these topics might seem a bit dry but I'm sure you'll find something useful let's jump in Legacy organizations have always been a bit tight lipped with their information in a lot of traditional companies having information is like having power so folks keep it to themselves they think it will make them look good keep their job safe and prevent others from using it the wrong way so they only share it when they really really have to now the big issue here is that a lot of this comes from two ways of thinking number one the idea that you just can't trust people and number two the fear that if you give that information out you'll lose your power but here's the kicker if we were more open and shared our information more freely we'd likely be able to do far more amazing things as organizations and as your species imagine you've got a huge network of tiny Parts all working together but no one's bossing them around they follow simple rules and somehow they create this amazing complicated Behavior they learn from experience and even change over time that's what Professor Melanie Mitchell from the Santa Fe Institute calls a complex adaptive system think of it like a hive mind that's way smarter together than any one part on its own Dows are no different Dows are complex adaptive systems they are like smart networks and everything they do depends on sharing information and learning from each each other if we really tap into this shared brain power we can do incredible things but what's a bit weird though is that we don't really focus much on how we find keep and share our knowledge we should be learning from nature and how it uses diverse information and smart incentives to solve problems if we can get the hang of that we'll be on to something really great it's difficult to overstate the degree to which DS should value and practice transparency imagine you're working on a giant puzzle with friends and each person has different pieces now you might find a piece that fits somewhere but maybe it's not in the area that you're working now you need to make sure that that piece gets to your friend who needs it in a dow great ideas can come from anywhere but they only help if the right person gets the right information at the right time economists call this information information symmetry so everyone in a d needs to be able to get the information they need in order to do their job well even if we default to trust and give contributors the freedom and autonomy to serve the organization's purpose they can only do so if they have all of the right information available to them in Dows transparency is a feature not a bug we have to Embrace Transparency we may be inclined to withhold information from our public forums and Discord channels out of a tendency to maintain competitive advantage against others outside of our Dow but Aaron dignan has this great quote in his book Brave New work he goes on to say we must accept that no one knows what information will prove to be critical or in which hands information might change everything more and better information and more and better ways to make sense of it is the source of competitive advantage in complexity in an open and permissionless network like a dow the pros of open information far outweigh the cons of competing organizations or network having the ability to see what you're doing so when it comes to maintaining your competitive Advantage we are on the side of information transparency over information siloing apps such as Google's workspace Trello charme Clarity and wonderverse all allow multiple us users to create and edit documents files and data simultaneously at Colony we use notion to document and record our knowledge base everything is open to everyone else inside the meta Colony so instead of information flying around from inbox to inbox everyone shares a single source of truth that is always just one click away teams can co-author presentations documents and even entire projects synchronously or asynchronously and of course course fully remote our code is fully open source and visible on GitHub and all contributors have access to work in progress our product designers work in figma which is also open and visible to everyone else in the Dow community and growth also use fig Jam extensively for brainstorming and whiteboarding with all files being open to everyone else now there are many new web 3 tools springing up such as charme and Clarity so although we are using notion currently as our knowledge base I'm sure we'll explore other Alternatives in the future when a culture is risk averse and teams lack the authority to make decisions about their own work work in progress usually goes underground because teams know that if they share incomplete or imperfect work leadership will likely poke holes in it and question their competence so we end up with cultures where everything has to be perfect before it is shared this leads needs to information silos that hurt everyone because two teams working on the same thing won't know about it until it's too late and anything and everything that could have been repurposed or reused is trapped in place instead we can work in public so developing our work in applications and environments that are visible too and searchable by everyone else in the D at Colony all our work in progress is public and open to everyone else within the Dow all teams have links to all of the projects that everyone else is working on and it is viewable by them the growth team for example can see how the product designs are developing developers can see where the marketing campaign is and product team members can see the progress of software development of all current features it's always better to share things with your fellow contributors too early than too late so see if you can cultivate a culture that defaults to openness but it's not only work in progress that should be open to all other teams communication should be open too that's where messaging apps like Discord slack Geneva and telegram come in at Colony not only do we house our community in Discord but we also keep all other internal communication across the entire Dell there no communication anywhere else now of course I'm probably preaching to the converted here already and I'm sure most of you use Discord or similar tools for communication but it's also really important to remember not to use back channeling and private DMS as much as possible default to communicating in your relevant public channels where any contributor has access to these conversations if you're unsure just ask yourself am I 100% certain no one else could benefit from this discussion nine times out of 10 the answer is no at Colony we also have a channel called daily standup where each team member at the start of the day answers the following three questions number one what did I do yesterday number two what have I got planned for today and number three are there any impediments in my way this part of our team Rhythm helps us keep ourselves accountable focus on the larger quarterly goals and provides Clarity to the rest of the teams it's just another way of increasing open communication across the Dow increased transparency is critical in the early stages of transforming your Dow's operating system because it's a prerequisite for making sound decisions one of the most common mistakes we see teams make is taking a swing at empowerment before ensuring transparency giving D members the authority to make decisions but keeping information confidential and on a need to know basis so what ends up happening well people make decisions without the benefit of crucial information and then those decisions are subpar and the leadership cries see people cannot be trusted to make decisions avoid this by focusing on sharing early and often make it safe make it habitual because when shared conscious is high everything else gets much easier with most Dows Gathering their Community inside of Discord it's common to see servers structured with transparency in mind too of course this varies greatly from Dow to D but at Colony we essentially have three layers of trust layer one has a set of channels which are open to everyone joining our Discord server layer 2 has an additional set of channels which are open to those who hold Colony native token clny the third and final layer adds all of the channels across our entire server and is open to anyone with reputation in The Meta Colony meaning they are a member of the D so anyone who does work for the meta colony and earns reputation gets access to everything just like the rest of the core team another powerful way to be transparent with the WID Community is to host regular Community calls or am a this is a very popular ritual which most Dows are hosting on a monthly or a bi-weekly basis the goal of these sessions is to provide the Dow Community with updates news and Tackle tough questions headon with amas in particular you'll find that a founder or a core contributor tends to answer questions directly from the community that's you these rituals really build trust confidence and credibility so it's something that we we would highly recommend if you're not doing so already the average employee attends 62 meetings a month and considers more than half of those meetings a waste of time meanwhile in our current times new tools have emerged that allow the more technologically savvy amongst us to communicate and coordinate across space and time virtually synchronously and asynchronously which is the case for practically all Ds now it's probably fair to say that all Ds have adopted some form of messaging applications like Discord telegram Geneva or slack but working in this asynchronous manner has resulted in some Dows attempting to avoid meetings altogether casting them out as wasteful and unnecessary in the future of work but to think that meetings have no place in the future of work would be a grave mistake like it or not great meetings offer higher bandwidth that's more information per second than any other form of communication when we communicate via Discord or telegram we have the option to communicate synchronously or asynchronously but we cannot hear each other and we cannot see each other and we have a limited ability to express or interpret comprehension emotion and energy but when we meet in person or on video in real time we communicate synchronously and we can hear one another to sense that audible emotion and energy we can see one another and sense bodily language and visible emotion and energy a million years of evolution didn't evaporate because we can now work asynchronously if we want to trust and if we want vibrant networks then eventually we will have to meet so the goal is then not to eliminate meetings as they are necessary but to eliminate unpr productive and non-essential meetings at Colony we only have three recurring organizational meetings the first is the quarterly okr meeting where we grade ourselves on the previous quarter objectives and key results we also set ourselves new okrs for the quarter ahead the second type of meeting is the bi-weekly Sprint meetings this is where each team communicates what they said they would do during the Sprint and also marks each task accordingly the team also shares what they aim to achieve during the next two we Sprint all tasks within the Sprint must be in alignment with this quarter okr if it's not an objective then we shouldn't be working on it all teams get a chance to do this so that the entire organization knows what's going on the third and final type of recurring meeting is a quarterly operating system meeting the goal of this meeting is for everyone to have a chance to voice their concerns and propose local changes to policies structure strategies and agreements we have in place anything that will help us improve the organization's operating system it gives us a short feedback loop on any decisions that we made collectively via the advice process or consent process and nothing is set in stone and it's important for us to keep testing our own assumptions and this meeting facilitates that I'd finally like to cover some meeting tips or hacks which can improve the effectiveness of your meetings meetings can actually be made more productive and efficient the first step is to start meetings by checking in begin with a question that allows everyone to connect on a human level in the world of dows where everyone is hiding behind an avatar it's easy to forget that we're all fellow contributors and real humans asynchronous communication can become very transactional so start your meetings by checking in at Colony we pick a random person to pose an icebreaker question to the rest of the teams or they can choose a Discord game to play for 15 minutes in small groups it really helps us to connect everyone and Elevate the energy in a fun and informal manner before the real meeting starts the second tip is to speak and participate in rounds when you really need to prioritize speed and inclusion in a meeting go around the virtual table and give everyone a chance to provide updates ask questions offer feed back or give consent depending on the type of meeting that you're holding everyone else is invited to listen respectfully and wait for their turn to speak now you'll notice that this is exactly the process for IDM integrative decision- making and that is because it's a very effective way to get everyone's input and make decisions quickly now it may seem a bit awkward at first but with practice it becomes really good the third and final tip is to appoint a facilitator one of the best ways to increase meeting Effectiveness is to ensure that someone is responsible for the structure and the flow and the output of every meeting now to do so appoint a facilitator the facilitator's role is to keep the meeting on track enforcing whatever format and ground rules the team has agreed upon they must make sure that no one hijacks the agenda and the meeting doesn't overrun again we've mentioned previously that a facilitator is crucial for the IDM meetings so start playing around with this idea to really see the benefits okay that's all the content for lesson number seven here's what you need to do next in your homework document I'd like you to tell us what your tool stack is for creating storing and organizing information in the Dow also write down all the Dow's recurring meetings and their purpose please complete these questions in your homework document ready for submission at the end of the the next lesson that's all for now I'll see you in the next final lesson very soon good [Music]
[Music] over the last seven lessons we've covered the foundational elements of your Dow's operating system from purpose and Mission all the way to information management and meetings these are the principles the Frameworks and the mindsets which you as a dow Builder must put into place at the beginning to ensure that your organization grows on a solid foundation if you've been completing your workbook exercises throughout this course you'll already have the basis of this developed now let's say your new operating system is in place your Dow is gaining momentum and everything is going great is that it have we done everything we need to to make sure that the Dow stays healthy and sustainable no of course not your Dow will always be in a state of transformation remember organizations are complex adaptive systems not complicated mechanical ones they are living systems not machines so how do you change a complex adaptive system well you try new things notice positive and negative patterns and then do more of what's working and less of what isn't and to do so we can Implement a process called looping this process is a key part of continuous learning and Improvement as highlighted in Aaron Dig's book Brave New work and contains three stages that are carried out recursively Step One is sensing tensions step two is proposing practices and step three is conducting experiment ments so let's take a deeper look at the process and how to bring it to life step one sensing tensions it's important to notice the stuff that bugs us at work because they can actually spark change you know those little annoyances that pop up when things AR going the way we want them to those are the tensions and they're a sign that something needs to change it's not just about spotting them but really understanding and prioritizing them leaders and teams should make an effort to pick up on these tensions Maybe by chatting in team meetings or having open conversations where everyone can feel like they can speak speak their mind sensing these tensions is the first step in changing things up it's like a compass showing us what needs a little tweaking step two proposing practices once we've figured out what these tensions are it's time to come up with some new ways of doing things to help tackle those issues this is where everyone should get creative think outside of the box and come up with some solutions that feel right for the Dow leaders and team should get together to brainstorm and get everyone's input and maybe even borrow some ideas from other organizations that have figured those things out suggesting new practices can lead to some pretty amazing ideas and can totally change the efficiency and Vibes at work and most importantly everyone should feel like they can throw in ideas into the mix it's all about making things better together and finally step three conducting experiments after we've got some practices to try out it's time to give them a test run start small and be structured about it kind of like a mini science experiment we can run a little trial see how it goes and then chat about what worked and what didn't the main thing is to make sure that everyone feels like it's okay to take risks and that if things don't go as planned it's no big deal because it's all part of the learning process by testing things out we can figure out what actually works works and what doesn't and then tweak things as we go it's all about keeping up with what everyone needs and making sure that work in the Dow is better for everyone now a good way to implement this looping process is to make it a recurring Workshop you can call it the OS Improvement or innovation Workshop because it's all about making your operating system better try to run them once a quarter at organizational level and even more frequently at working group or Team level for this this Workshop you'll be bringing your Dow members together to identify tensions proposing practices and creating experiments using a digital whiteboard solution like fig Jam mural or Myro below this video you'll find a fig Jam template an instructional video on how to facilitate such a workshop remember the only constant in life is change so embrace it it's not always easy but Dows are in a unique position to fight against the status quo and bring about global change through our Collective intelligence and collaborative strength by pulling our diverse perspectives experiences and resources together we can Pioneer innovative solutions and create a more Equitable transparent and decentralized future for all and now you have all the tools you need to participate in this evolution of the onchain organization by building your own Dow okay this was your final lesson with educational content there's nothing more to learn in this season 1 course remember to check out the OS Improvement temp and instructional video below to help you implement the looping process in your own Dow I'll see you in the last video to wrap up this course and let you know what you should do next[Music]
[Music] and there you go congratulations for making it through the Dow Club season one course I hope you've enjoyed this first part of your Dow Club Journey we started with a vision the idea of creating a dowel that grows and makes a real impact and now you've got the building blocks and the tools to make that Vision a reality you've got the knowledge about purpose and mission strategy membership structure workflow Authority resources compensation and information management it's a lot I know but it's all part of shaping the operating system for your Dell if I could only share four aspects to remember from this entire course it would be the following number one purpose and Mission make sure you and everyone else in the Dow knows why the work you do is important and what you're doing to realize this purpose number two autonomy all members and teams should be able to self-manage and self-organize members must have the freedom and responsibility to use their skills judgment and feedback loops to steer and serve the Dao's purpose number three consent all policy decisions agreements rules roles structures and resources can be made through the informed consent of those impacted by that decision there's no need to jump straight into on-chain governance when almost all decisions can and should be made off chain first especially in the early days and number four transparency all information should be made available and accessible to all other members within the Dow individuals and themes should default to open when it comes to sharing data information knowledge and insights this course has given you the tools but the real work starts now it's time to roll up your sleeves and take those first steps towards building your Dow start with the purpose and the mission your North Star and then slowly step by step put the other pieces of your operating system in place now it might take time to see real progress but that's okay just embrace the journey and learn from the experiences that come your way and remember you won't be doing this by yourself and you really shouldn't tap into the power of your community and involve those who share your passion and your vision together you can create something truly remarkable now once you've completed your workbook submit a link to yours via the form below it's your ticket to the next level Dow Club season 2. we'll dive even deeper and you'll have the chance to join a small cohort of fellow Dow builders for live meetings workshops and expert guest speaker events season two is where you'll really get to connect and collaborate and create I know we've covered a lot of ground in this course and it's maybe a little bit overwhelming at first but don't worry I am still here to support you if you have any questions or you need some guidance from myself just send me a DM right here in colonies Discord server I'll be more than happy to help you now to those of you who are eager to continue this journey and dive into Seasons two and three I can't wait to see you right here and to those of you who are taking a moment to just catch your breath and let everything sink in before launching your Dell that's perfectly okay too I'll see you for the next season when you're ready but until then take care and good luck bye bye foreign [Music]
